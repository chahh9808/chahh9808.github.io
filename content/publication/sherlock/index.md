abstract: With the rapid advancements in surveillance camera technology, there has been a surge in crimes involving illegal filming using hidden cameras. However, current solutions necessitate slow manual scanning processes that require thousands ofworkers within a city to ensure coverage. To address this challenge, we introduce Sherlock, a fully automated hidden camera detection system that utilizes a drone in combination with a flickering flashlight. To expedite the scanning process and accommodate the irregular movements of the drone, Sherlock leverages the rolling shutter effect to capture images when the flashlight is turned on and off within a single frame. This methodology enables Sherlock to efficiently identify reflective objects and detect hidden camera lenses among them. To demonstrate the feasibility of Sherlock, we present a proof-of-concept evaluation by deploying a drone in various environments to detect and locate hidden cameras.
